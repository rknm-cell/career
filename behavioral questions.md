# Behavioral Interview Practice Session

## Question 1: Taking Ownership
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you took ownership of a project. Why did you do this? What was the result of you taking the challenge? What could have happened if you did not take ownership?

**Answer:** I had been hired as a freelancer for a particular job where the task was to cast a production run of 40 8' tall statues for Burberry. In my role I was tasked to help out in the job. I had no experience casting before this project, and was given light training in the subject. While I was working, there was little in the way of organization and I had noticed materials weren't handled properly and procedures were not being followed, resulting in statues not being properly made. I was only a freelancer, but I took professional pride in my work, so I took control and started instructing the other freelance coworkers on best practices and how to handle the materials. The result was statues were being created more efficiently and at a faster pace. If I had not taken ownership, the run of statues would not have been completed in time.

**Follow-up:** How did the other freelancers respond when you started giving them instruction? And how did you approach that situation - did you worry about overstepping boundaries since you were also just a freelancer?

**Follow-up Answer:** At first, people bristled at me taking charge, but quickly saw the results of my actions and started following my lead. Management noticed my initiative and ability to quickly learn on the job. They offered me a fulltime position after the project had finished. I did not worry about overstepping boundaries at the time, other freelancers bristled at me taking change. In hindsight, I would've been much more careful about overstepping boundaries and would've spent more time talking to the other freelancers about the process and win them over to my approach.

## Question 2: Adaptability
**Question:** Describe a situation in which you have experienced a significant project change that you weren't expecting. What was it? How did that impact you, and how did you adapt to this change? How did you remain productive throughout the project?

**Answer:** I worked on a project where we were installing a set into a retail window display, and half of the sets were too tall for the display. We had to send them back to the studio to be cut down to size. It was stressful and frustrating, but I was able to adapt to it, by working on what was available and preparing what pieces we had available so we could quickly set up once we got the pieces in. Despite the delay this caused, we were able to compensate for the delay with preparation and being ready to install the sets once we were able to receive them.

## Question 3: Communication Skills
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you had to present a complex technical problem to a person that didn't understand technical jargon. How did you ensure that the other person understood you?

**Initial Answer:** I like to explain to my girlfriend the different tech I work with in a way she can understand it, because it helps me parse out my knowledge and check to see if I can explain it well enough to a non-technical person. I find that if I cannot explain things well without technical jargon, than I need to learn more so that I can understand it more deeply.

**Workplace Example:** I was making 3d prints with a new material. I had to explain to my manager why, normally we would be able to print out 4 pieces at a time, we slowed down to 3. I had to rearrange the material pieces in such a way that in order to get our desired results the printer could only hold 3 at a time.

**Detailed Explanation:** We had made the prototypes with an opaque material, which would normally be okay to print out in such a way where they might slightly overlap with their support struts, but it was okay because we could sand down the strut pieces off the surface. We switched over to clear material, and as such there was no way to fix the surface if there were struts visible on them. With this in mind, I had to space them out in order for the pieces to print out clearly.

## Question 4: Problem-Solving/Learning from Mistakes
**Question:** Tell me about a situation when you made a mistake at work. What happened exactly and how did you deal with it? What steps did you take to improve the situation?

**Answer:** I was casting large diamonds for ring pop lamps. In order to cast them to the specific requirements they had to be cast within 5 minutes of mixing. It couldn't be more or than that or they'd come out warped. They had to be plastic wrapped after they were cast or they would leak material everywhere. I made a cast but then I found that the plastic wrap wasn't where I needed it to be. The cast was wasted. From that point on I made sure I had a checklist of everything that I needed before going forward with casting.

## Question 5: Teamwork/Handling Underperformance
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you worked with someone who was not completing their share of the work. How did you handle the situation? Did you discuss your concern with your coworker? With your manager? How did your coworker respond to your concern?

**Answer:** I was applying bodyfiller to a long channel along the edge of a table. The edge of the table had to be level and smooth but have body filler the whole way. My coworker was being using too much bodyfiller, so the surface was lumpy and irregular, which resulted and them having to sand it down and start over. I talked to them and gave them guidance to use less material and to move slower, so that whenever they applied the material it was smooth and level.

**Follow-up:** How did your coworker respond when you gave them that feedback? Were they receptive to your guidance, or was there any pushback? And was this someone who was at the same level as you, or were you in more of a supervisory role?

**Follow-up Answer:** My coworker was receptive to my advice. We were equal employees, although I had more seniority as I had been working there longer.
